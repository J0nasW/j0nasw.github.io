    "text": "In our Entrepreneurial Finance course, we had the great pleasure to welcome Mark Miller, founding partner at Carlsquare, one of the leading consultancies in Europe for mergers & acquisitions (M&A) of growth-oriented and innovative medium-sized companies. Mark gave an insightful overview into the M&A market in Europe, Carlsquare’s approach to support an acquisition process, and two exciting case studies, rounded up by a teaser of what a career as an M&A consultant could look lilke.\nThe students very much enjoyed the talk and were engaging actively with our guest. Thank you very much, Mark! See you next time.",

By the end of the course, students will be skilled in applying modern innovation tools, analyzing and designing business models, and making informed decisions about business opportunities.
